      <p class='text-content'>
        Hello! I'm Krizel, a software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA.
      </p>
      <p class='text-content'>
        Ever since I was little... I've loved all things internet: digital
        marketing, web development and graphic design. Nowadays, I'm passionate
        about building web experiences that aren't just elegant and efficent,
        but applications that speak. Shortly after graduating from Northeastern
        University, I joined the engineering team at Upstatement where I work on
        a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.
